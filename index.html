        <br/>
        <ul>
            <li>
                During my internship at Excellence Technology as a data science intern, I gained valuable 
                experience and acquired several skills.
            </li> 
            <li>
                Throughout the internship, I learned SQL, Python, Excel, and visualization software such as 
                Power BI.
            </li>  
            <li> 
                We collaborated on a project called hand gesture recognition. In this project, we developed a 
                model that uses a neural network to detect a person's hand gestures, such as okay, thumbs up, 
                thumbs down, rock, smile, etc., and displays the name of the gesture on the screen. The model 
                was trained using a dataset to recognize these gestures.
